# Organization Chart sample
This sample demonstrate how to create a simple Organization Chart Layout using [Blazor Diagram](SfDiagramComponent).

Organizational chart layout starts parsing from root and iterate through all its child elements. The GetLayoutInfo event callback method provides necessary information of a nodeâ€™s children and the way to arrange (direction, orientation, offsets, etc.)them. The arrangements can be customized by overriding this function as explained.
