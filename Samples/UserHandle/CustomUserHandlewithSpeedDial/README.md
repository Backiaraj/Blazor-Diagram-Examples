# UserHandle sample

This sample demonstrate how to create a userhandle in speeddial component.

We used the speeddial component in the userhandle template in this example. Using the SpeedDial template property, we rendered the colorpicker and textbox in the SpeedDial item. Using the colorpicker in the speedial component, we can change the fill colour of a node. We can also use this textbox in the speedial component to add any text.
