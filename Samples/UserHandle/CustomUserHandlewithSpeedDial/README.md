# Custom Userhandle as a SpeedDial component

This sample demonstrate how to create a custom userhandle as  speeddial component.

We have a userhandle property for selector element in diagram component. We can add any tool, such as copy delete, to this userhandle. The template property of the userhanle allows us to customise it.

In this example, we used the speeddial component in the userhandle template. We rendered the colorpicker and textbox in the SpeedDial item using the SpeedDial template property. We can change the fill colour of a node using the colorpicker in the speedial component. This textbox in the speedial component can also be used to add any text.
