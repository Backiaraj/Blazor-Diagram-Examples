#Briging Sample

This sample demonstrates how to enable line bridging. The line bridging creates a bridge for lines to smartly cross over the other lines at points of intersection. By default, the BridgeDirection is set to Top depending upon the direction given bridging direction appears. Bridging can be enabled or disabled either with the Connector.Constraints or Diagram.Constraints.
